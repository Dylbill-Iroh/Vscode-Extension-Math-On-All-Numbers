# Math On All Numbers README
Apply math operations to all numbers in current selection, or entire document. Currently only for int or decimal type numbers.

## How to use
- Search for commands using ctrl + shift + p.
- Run the command "Math On All Numbers".
- Enter an operator + value to operate by. e.g +1, -2.2, *3, /4.2, %5, ^6 ect...
- This will alter numbers in current selection, or entire document if nothing is selected.
- Decimal places will be fixed to either the amount of decimals are in the text, or in the operator value, whichever is greater. 
- Example, using /2 on 9 will change it to 5, using /2.0 on 9 will change it to 4.5, using /2.00 will change it to 4.50, ect...
- The "Math On All Numbers - Perform Last Operation" command runs the last math operator used.
